      <article><p>Cloud Bakery was born from the passion and determination of a young Japanese immigrant, a self-taught baker who chose to follow his heart over convention. After turning down offers to study law and violin, he embraced his love for baking, blending traditional Japanese techniques with the sophistication of French patisserie. With a deep respect for heritage and an artist’s eye for detail, he has created a beloved local haven where every pastry tells a story of courage, tradition, and elegance.</p></article>
